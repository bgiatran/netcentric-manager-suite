# Project Log â€” Bria Tran

### 1. Initial Setup

- Wrote the first version of the CoreHTTP library and set up the project skeleton (file structure, public folder, items.json).
- Shared the initial version on GitHub for team collaboration.

### 2. Server-Side Refinement

- Converted server to use JSON storage and finalized API route structure.
- Added complete error handling and refactored server.js for clarity and project requirements.

### 3. Frontend Integration

- Connected CoreHTTP and app.js to the server and API routes.
- Implemented and tested GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, and PATCH functionality; fixed any incomplete or missing parts.

### 4. UI/Styling

- Centered and styled the UI to match the project example and standardized button styles.
- Connected the app to the MongoDB Atlas database and worked on the styling and layout of the user interface.
