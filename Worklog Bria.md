Project Log / Team Update:
I finished writing the first version of the HTTP library and set up the basic project skeleton, including file structure, and basic utilities. Iâ€™ve shared the code with the team so everyone can add their input, revise parts as needed, and help polish and complete the implementation.

Version Control / Commit Message:
Initial commit of base HTTP. Uploaded to GitHub so teammates can collaborate on refining and finalizing the code.
